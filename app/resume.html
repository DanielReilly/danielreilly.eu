					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>
						I started working as a developer in February 2012 after a brief but useful time in Strathclyde
						University and in
						the period since, have had the privilege of meeting and offering my help to a wide range of
						developers, start-ups,
						and small businesses from Edinburgh to San Francisco.
					</p>

					<p>
						I enjoy working on exciting projects, and working on my development workflow. I like to work
						with new and exciting
						tools and framework that allow me to develop new features faster and more efficiently.
					</p>

					<p>
						Over the last few years I have attended various talks, conferences and workshops to improve my
						skill set including
						Google I/O and I have worked at the Turing Festival in Edinburgh.
					</p>

					<p>
						Recently I have been gaining experience in the Angularjs, Flask, Swagger and Web2py frameworks
						while working in a small
						focused team to build a web app. While providing support to existing users. I continue to learn
						more and more about
						these technologies as I go along and hope to continue working with them for a number of years as
						I feel that these
						technologies will only improve with age.
					</p>

					<p>
						Working in a small team has given me a wide range of transferable big and small business skills.
						I have learned to
						work on the full stack and work under the pressure of a small team for a big client.

					<h2>Junior Software Developer at MacLaren West</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">Febuary 2012 - Present</p>

					<p>
						I have been at MacLaren West Full Time since leaving university and on a part-time basis while
						studying.
						During this time I have split my time between software support and development. I have been able
						to develop my
						skills in a small team of 3 while working for several big clients including the FSA.
					</p>

					<p>
						At the moment we are building a web system for our existing desktop system in which we are using
						a Python backend,
						a swagger API and a front end that takes advantage of AngularJS. I am mostly responsible for
						front end development
						and support.
					</p>

					<p>
						During this time I have also done manual testing on the Applications that we develop. I have
						developed a process for
						doing this incorporating all of the features being developed and existing. I have also had the
						chance to document
						most of the software that we develop which we are looking at making the process a little easier
						with in our new web
						system.

					<h2>Web Developer at Moviecom.tv</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">May 2012 - August 2012</p>

					<p>
						At Moviecom, I was tasked at helping with the implementation and maintaining their YouTube API
						integration for
						their upcoming presentation in San Francisco at Google I/O. This work was completed before we
						left Glasgow.
						I was on hand to assist if necessary in San Francisco but also to attend the conference and
						network.
					</p>

					<p>
						I also provided a full overview of their technical structure and provided details on how to
						improve upon this.
						This work was never carried out as my employers with Moviecom moved on from the company in
						August 2012 when I left employment with them to focus
						on 29Studios, their other venture who I eventually worked for on a freelance basis.

					<h2>Web Developer at 29Studios</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">March 2013 - October 2013</p>

					<p>
						While working with 29Studios I was solely responsible for building web based applications for
						some of their many clients.
						I worked with them on a contract basis as a sideline to my MacLaren West work.
					</p>

					<p>
						I was tasked with building 2 applications during my time there. These were small applications in
						which I was given the choice of
						technologies used, hosting, how they were delivered and implemented and was tasked with writing
						them myself.
					</p>

					<p>
						I chose to build these two applications in Python (App Engine) for it's ease of deployment and
						use and so
						that I could implement any small change requests without needing to take a huge amount of time
						out of my nights.
						I was also using this becuase I wanted an easy way to trnsfer ownership to the client at the end
						of the job.

					<h2>Cumbernauld College</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">HNC Computing</p>

					<p>
						I completed my HNC in Computing in order to gain access to Strathclyde to do Computer Science.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the time that I had in college, I had gained valuable skills in learning about both
						Windows and Unix
						environments. I travelled to Cumbria to compete in a competition against other students from
						around the UK for configuring
						Windows Applications.
					</p>

					<p>
						I enjoyed my time here and I feel it gave me some valuable skills and contacts for my future
						career.

					<h2>Strathclyde University</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">Computer Science</p>

					<p>
						My time at Strathclyde was limited but valuable. I gained experience working in a software
						development team,
						mainly through the University organised Amazon Hackathon which eventually led to me finding work
						with Moviecom.tv.
						I have detailed more about this under side projects
					</p>

					<p>
						I had some good learning experiences here too. Learning some core programming concepts and
						theories along with
						a number of basic computer science principles put me on good footing for the future.
					</p>

					<p>
						I eventually left to work full time with MacLaren West and gain industry experience with the aim
						of going back
						to complete my degree after a year. I have decided to continue my career without my degree at
						the moment as I feel
						there are still some things I would like to learn and work in practice with before continuing
						education.
