					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>
						I started working as a developer in February 2012 after a brief but useful time in Strathclyde
						University and in the period since, have had the privilege of meeting and offering my help to a
                        wide range of developers, start-ups, and small businesses from Glasgow and Edinburgh to San Francisco.
					</p>

					<p>
						I enjoy working on exciting projects, and working with new 'Bleeding-Edge' technologies. I like to work
						with a well organised set of tools and frameworkswhich I consistently improve upon to allow me to develop
                        new features faster and more efficiently.
					</p>

					<p>
						Over the last few years I have attended various talks, conferences and workshops to improve my
						skill set including Google I/O and I have worked at the Turing Festival in Edinburgh. I am currently
                        building an application for Fuse Technology to assist in making the experience for both users and
                        organisers at these types of events more efficient and relevant. I complete all work for this project
                        in my spare time.
					</p>

					<p>
						Working in a small team has given me a wide range of transferable big and small business skills.
						I have learned to work on the full development stack and work under pressure. Working on my side
                        project for Fuse Technology, I have gained valuable skills which include; pitching and presentation
                        skills, project management skills, development with the Swift language and iOS development in XCode.
                        The whole Fuse Technology process has accelerated my learning substantially and helped me grow as a
                        professional.

                    <h2>Founder/Developer at Fuse Technology</h2>

                    <p class="subDetails">January 2015 - Present</p>

                    <p>
                        I have built Fuse Technology from the start of 2015, in that time I have created all business
                        documentation, delivered pitches to potential users or investors while managing and leading product
                        development in iOS/Swift.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During this project the company has been purely a side project with me building the product on
                        evenings and weekends while working weekdays 9-5. My motivation for seeking new employment is partly
                        influenced by my desire for greater weekday flexibility in order for me to continue this personal
                        development journey with Fuse Technology while striving to make truly useful products while applying
                        the lessons I have learned to all aspects of my professional life.

					<h2>Developer and Software Support at MacLaren West</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">Febuary 2012 - Present</p>

					<p>
						I have been at MacLaren West Full Time since leaving university and on a part-time basis while
						studying. During this time I have split my time between software support and development. I have been able
						to develop my skills in a small team of 3 while working for several big clients including a large UK Government
                        agency.
					</p>

					<p>
						At the moment we are working on mainly software support for our largest project which involves
                        dealing with users across the UK and solving their issues with our software. In this time I have
                        dealt with a range of issues including Windows networking problems and thin client solutions while
                        working with users to make sure they comply with PSN guidelines and working with underlying application
                        data.
					</p>

					<p>
						During my time here, I have also done manual testing on the Applications that we develop. I have
						developed an optimal process for doing so incorporating all of the features being developed and
                        existing. I have also had the chance to write user documentation, technical spec and support our
                        current application during my time here. I built the company web page in Angular using bootstrap
                        services which has attracted several client conversions and have designed a web portal and iOS application
                        to consume an API that is currently going through an integration process with our software.

					<h2>Web Developer at Moviecom.tv</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">May 2012 - August 2012</p>

					<p>
						At Moviecom, I was tasked at helping with the implementation and maintaining their YouTube API
						integration for
						their upcoming presentation in San Francisco at Google I/O. This work was completed before we
						left Glasgow.
						I was on hand to assist if necessary in San Francisco but also to attend the conference and
						network.
					</p>

					<p>
						I provided a full overview of their technical structure and provided consultancy on how to
						improve upon this.

					<h2>Web Developer at 29Studios</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">March 2013 - October 2013</p>

					<p>
						While working with 29Studios I was solely responsible for building web based applications for
						some of their many clients. I worked with them on a contract basis alongside my work with MacLaren West.
					</p>

					<p>
						I was tasked with building 2 applications during my time there. These were small applications in
						which I was tasked with selecting the technologies used, hosting, how they were delivered and implemented
                        and was tasked with writing them myself.
					</p>

					<p>
						I chose to build these two applications in Python (App Engine) for it's ease of deployment and
						use and to implement any small change requests without large overheads and the ownership transfer
                        capabilities at the end of project.

					<h2>Cumbernauld College</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">HNC Computing</p>

					<p>
						I completed my HNC in Computing in order to gain access to Strathclyde to do Computer Science.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the time that I had in college, I had gained valuable skills in learning about both
						Windows and Unix
						environments. I travelled to Cumbria to compete in a competition against other students from
						around the UK for configuring
						Windows Applications.
					</p>

					<p>
						I enjoyed my time here and I feel it gave me some valuable skills and contacts for my future
						career.

					<h2>Strathclyde University</h2>

					<p class="subDetails">Computer Science</p>

					<p>
						My time at Strathclyde was limited but valuable. I gained experience working in a software
						development team,
						mainly through the University organised Amazon Hackathon which eventually led to me finding work
						with Moviecom.tv.
						I have detailed more about this under side projects
					</p>

					<p>
						I had some good learning experiences here too. Learning some core programming concepts and
						theories along with
						a number of basic computer science principles put me on good footing for the future.
					</p>

					<p>
						I eventually left to work full time with MacLaren West and gain industry experience with the aim
						of going back
						to complete my degree after a year. I have decided to continue my career without my degree at
						the moment as I feel
						there are still some things I would like to learn and work in practice with before continuing
						education.

					<p>
						I am looking to work somewhere innovative that pushes the boundaries and always looking at ways

                        that this fits my personality as a developer and employee. I am looking for somewhere that I can
                        use my skills intuition and ideas to make a positive impact while learning and being part of an
                        enthusiastic and motivated team along the way.
